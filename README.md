Also a thank you to Brian Cherne for creating the JQuery used in order to make the buttons drawer appear by judging the users intent when hovering, which is why the JQuery is called Hover Intent. This determines whether or not the user wants the buttons drawer to open simply by judging whether the mouse has stopped moving while over the area that makes the drawer open. With the standard JQuery coding, the drawer would open exactly when the mouse goes the area that makes the drawer open, regardless of the user wanting this to do so. This is version 1.9.1 and used under the MIT license. http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
